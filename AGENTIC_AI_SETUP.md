# Agentic AI System Setup Guide

## Overview
The SafeSpace platform now includes an advanced agentic AI system that automatically analyzes incident descriptions, assesses severity, and helps lodge FIRs (First Information Reports) for severe cases. This system provides intelligent, proactive assistance to women experiencing workplace harassment.

## ü§ñ AI System Features

### 1. **Intelligent Incident Analysis**
- **Severity Assessment**: AI analyzes incident descriptions and classifies them as:
  - **Critical**: Physical violence, threats to life, immediate danger
  - **High**: Serious harassment, stalking, repeated incidents
  - **Medium**: Moderate harassment, inappropriate behavior
  - **Low**: Minor incidents, isolated inappropriate comments

- **Legal Analysis**: Provides legal implications and relevant IPC sections
- **Recommendations**: Offers specific, actionable advice based on severity
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifies potential risk factors and safety concerns

### 2. **Automatic Police Station Detection**
- **Location Access**: Automatically gets user's GPS coordinates (with permission)
- **Nearby Search**: Finds the nearest police stations within 10km radius
- **Distance Calculation**: Uses Haversine formula for accurate distance calculation
- **Contact Information**: Provides police station details (name, address, phone)

### 3. **FIR Generation & Submission**
- **Automatic Generation**: Creates formal FIR drafts for severe incidents
- **Police Station Integration**: Submits FIRs to the nearest police station
- **FIR Number Assignment**: Generates official FIR numbers upon successful submission
- **Status Tracking**: Tracks FIR status (draft, submitted, approved, lodged)

### 4. **Dashboard Integration**
- **Activity Tracking**: Shows FIR activities in the dashboard's recent activity section
- **Status Updates**: Real-time updates on FIR submission status
- **Quick Actions**: Direct links to call police stations and get directions

## üöÄ How It Works

### Step 1: Automatic Incident Description Analysis
1. User enters incident description in the log incident page
2. **AI automatically analyzes the text after 2 seconds of inactivity** (debounced)
3. System determines severity level and provides recommendations
4. For critical/high severity cases, automatically requests location access

### Step 2: Police Station Detection
1. System gets user's current GPS coordinates
2. Searches for nearby police stations in the database
3. Calculates distances and ranks stations by proximity
4. Selects the nearest station for FIR submission

### Step 3: FIR Generation
1. Creates a formal FIR draft with all incident details
2. Includes police station information and contact details
3. Preserves user privacy by using anonymous complainant details
4. Shows FIR review dialog for user approval

### Step 4: FIR Submission
1. User reviews and approves FIR details
2. System submits FIR to the selected police station
3. Receives confirmation and FIR number
4. Updates dashboard with FIR activity
